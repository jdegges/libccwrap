# libccwrap: compiler collection wrapper library

This library provides a simple interface to a compiler binary installed on your
system. Inspired by tinycc (http://bellard.org/tcc/), this library aims to
allow users to compile and run C code from within their applications at runtime.

Currently the library is only configured to compile code with `cc'. On most
systems this should point to gcc.

# Dependencies

* libpthread:   Used to allow thread safe execution of all exposed functions.
* libltdl:      A system independent dlopen wrapper. Used to dynamically link
                with compiled modules.
